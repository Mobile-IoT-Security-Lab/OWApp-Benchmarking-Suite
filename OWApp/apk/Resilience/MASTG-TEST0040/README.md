# [MASTG-TEST-0040: Testing for Debugging Symbols](https://mas.owasp.org/MASTG/tests/android/MASVS-RESILIENCE/MASTG-TEST-0040)
## Overview
MASVS-RESILIENCE-3 / MSTG-CODE-3 / May 08, 2023

## Implementation
The application performs the addition of two numbers using a native library.
Symbols are usually stripped during the build process, so you need the compiled bytecode and libraries to make sure that unnecessary metadata has been discarded.
In the build.gradle there is not the following configuration:
```java
    
externalNativeBuild {
    cmake {
        cppFlags "-fvisibility=hidden"
    }
}
```


## Static Analysis
Symbols are usually stripped during the build process, so you need the compiled bytecode and libraries to make sure that unnecessary metadata has been discarded.

First, find the `nm` binary in your Android NDK and export it (or create an alias).

```
export NM = $ANDROID_NDK_DIR/toolchains/arm-linux-androideabi-4.9/prebuilt/darwin-x86_64/bin/arm-linux-androideabi-nm
```

To display debug symbols:

```
$NM -a libfoo.so
/tmp/toolchains/arm-linux-androideabi-4.9/prebuilt/darwin-x86_64/bin/arm-linux-androideabi-nm: libfoo.so: no symbols
```

To display dynamic symbols:

```
$NM -D libfoo.so
```

Alternatively, open the file in your favorite disassembler and check the symbol tables manually.

Dynamic symbols can be stripped via the `visibility` compiler flag. Adding this flag causes gcc to discard the function names while preserving the names of functions declared as `JNIEXPORT`.

Make sure that the following has been added to build.gradle:

```
externalNativeBuild {
    cmake {
        cppFlags "-fvisibility=hidden"
    }
}
```
