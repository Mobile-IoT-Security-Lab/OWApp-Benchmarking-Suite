# [MASTG-TEST-0043: Memory Corruption Bugs](https://mas.owasp.org/MASTG/tests/android/MASVS-CODE/MASTG-TEST-0043)

## Overview
MASVS-CODE-4 / MSTG-CODE-8 / May 08, 2023

## Static Analysis

There are various items to look for:

- Are there native code parts? If so: check for the given issues in the general memory corruption section. Native code can easily be spotted given JNI-wrappers, .CPP/.H/.C files, NDK or other native frameworks.

- Is there Java code or Kotlin code? Look for Serialization/deserialization issues, such as described in [A brief history of Android deserialization vulnerabilities](https://securitylab.github.com/research/android-deserialization-vulnerabilities/).

Note that there can be Memory leaks in Java/Kotlin code as well. Look for various items, such as: BroadcastReceivers which are not unregistered, static references to `Activity` or `View` classes, Singleton classes that have references to `Context`, Inner Class references, Anonymous Class references, AsyncTask references, Handler references, Threading done wrong, TimerTask references.
