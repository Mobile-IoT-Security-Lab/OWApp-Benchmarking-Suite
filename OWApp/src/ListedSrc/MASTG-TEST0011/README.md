# [MASTG-TEST-0011: Testing Memory for Sensitive Data](https://mas.owasp.org/MASTG/tests/android/MASVS-STORAGE/MASTG-TEST-0011)

## Overview

Analyzing memory can help developers identify the root causes of several problems, such as application crashes. However, it can also be used to access sensitive data. This section describes how to check for data disclosure via process memory.

First identify sensitive information that is stored in memory. Sensitive assets have likely been loaded into memory at some point. The objective is to verify that this information is exposed as briefly as possible.

To investigate an application's memory, you must first create a memory dump. You can also analyze the memory in real-time, e.g., via a debugger. Regardless of your approach, memory dumping is a very error-prone process in terms of verification because each dump contains the output of executed functions. You may miss executing critical scenarios. In addition, overlooking data during analysis is probable unless you know the data's footprint (either the exact value or the data format). For example, if the app encrypts with a randomly generated symmetric key, you likely won't be able to spot it in memory unless you can recognize the key's value in another context.

Therefore, you are better off starting with static analysis.

## Implementation
A Note Manager app with a login (admin, 1234) has been created. Notes are saved in a text file note.txt and are encrypted using the key (Talos), triggering the vulnerability Sensitive Data Handling (The application stores the encryption key in memory as a String object). When logging out, the method does not properly clear the encryption key from memory `this.encryptionKey = null;`, triggering the vulnerability User Authentication (The application doesn't clear sensitive data from memory when the user signs out, leaving the encryption key and potentially decrypted notes accessible in memory until the application is closed).

## Static Analysis

When performing static analysis to identify sensitive data that is exposed in memory, you should:

- Try to identify application components and map where data is used.
- Make sure that sensitive data is handled by as few components as possible.
- Make sure that object references are properly removed once the object containing the sensitive data is no longer needed.
- Make sure that garbage collection is requested after references have been removed.
- Make sure that sensitive data gets overwritten as soon as it is no longer needed.
  - Don't represent such data with immutable data types (such as `String` and `BigInteger`).
  - Avoid non-primitive data types (such as `StringBuilder`).
  - Overwrite references before removing them, outside the `finalize` method.
  - Pay attention to third-party components (libraries and frameworks). Public APIs are good indicators. Determine whether the public API handles the sensitive data as described in this chapter.

The following section describes pitfalls of data leakage in memory and best practices for avoiding them.

Don't use immutable structures (e.g., `String` and `BigInteger`) to represent secrets. Nullifying these structures will be ineffective: the garbage collector may collect them, but they may remain on the heap after garbage collection. Nevertheless, you should ask for garbage collection after every critical operation (e.g., encryption, parsing server responses that contain sensitive information). When copies of the information have not been properly cleaned (as explained below), your request will help reduce the length of time for which these copies are available in memory.

To properly clean sensitive information from memory, store it in primitive data types, such as byte-arrays (`byte[]`) and char-arrays (`char[]`). You should avoid storing the information in mutable non-primitive data types.

Make sure to overwrite the content of the critical object once the object is no longer needed. Overwriting the content with zeroes is one simple and very popular method:

Example in Java:
```
byte[] secret = null;
try{
    //get or generate the secret, do work with it, make sure you make no local copies
} finally {
    if (null != secret) {
        Arrays.fill(secret, (byte) 0);
    }
}
```
Example in Kotlin:
```
val secret: ByteArray? = null
try {
     //get or generate the secret, do work with it, make sure you make no local copies
} finally {
    if (null != secret) {
        Arrays.fill(secret, 0.toByte())
    }
}
```
This doesn't, however, guarantee that the content will be overwritten at runtime. To optimize the bytecode, the compiler will analyze and decide not to overwrite data because it will not be used afterwards (i.e., it is an unnecessary operation). Even if the code is in the compiled DEX, the optimization may occur during the just-in-time or ahead-of-time compilation in the VM.

There is no silver bullet for this problem because different solutions have different consequences. For example, you may perform additional calculations (e.g., XOR the data into a dummy buffer), but you'll have no way to know the extent of the compiler's optimization analysis. On the other hand, using the overwritten data outside the compiler's scope (e.g., serializing it in a temp file) guarantees that it will be overwritten but obviously impacts performance and maintenance.

Then, using Arrays.fill to overwrite the data is a bad idea because the method is an obvious hooking target (see "Method Hooking" for more details).

The final issue with the above example is that the content was overwritten with zeroes only. You should try to overwrite critical objects with random data or content from non-critical objects. This will make it really difficult to construct scanners that can identify sensitive data on the basis of its management.

Below is an improved version of the previous example:

Example in Java:
```
byte[] nonSecret = somePublicString.getBytes("ISO-8859-1");
byte[] secret = null;
try{
    //get or generate the secret, do work with it, make sure you make no local copies
} finally {
    if (null != secret) {
        for (int i = 0; i < secret.length; i++) {
            secret[i] = nonSecret[i % nonSecret.length];
        }

        FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream("/dev/null");
        out.write(secret);
        out.flush();
        out.close();
    }
}
```
Example in Kotlin:
```
val nonSecret: ByteArray = somePublicString.getBytes("ISO-8859-1")
val secret: ByteArray? = null
try {
     //get or generate the secret, do work with it, make sure you make no local copies
} finally {
    if (null != secret) {
        for (i in secret.indices) {
            secret[i] = nonSecret[i % nonSecret.size]
        }

        val out = FileOutputStream("/dev/null")
        out.write(secret)
        out.flush()
        out.close()
        }
}
```
For more information, take a look at Securely Storing Sensitive Data in RAM .

In the "Static Analysis" section, we mentioned the proper way to handle cryptographic keys when you are using AndroidKeyStore or SecretKey.

For a better implementation of SecretKey, look at the SecureSecretKey class below. Although the implementation is probably missing some boilerplate code that would make the class compatible with SecretKey, it addresses the main security concerns:

No cross-context handling of sensitive data. Each copy of the key can be cleared from within the scope in which it was created.
The local copy is cleared according to the recommendations given above.
Example in Java:
```

 public class SecureSecretKey implements javax.crypto.SecretKey, Destroyable {
      private byte[] key;
      private final String algorithm;

      /** Constructs SecureSecretKey instance out of a copy of the provided key bytes.
        * The caller is responsible of clearing the key array provided as input.
        * The internal copy of the key can be cleared by calling the destroy() method.
        */
      public SecureSecretKey(final byte[] key, final String algorithm) {
          this.key = key.clone();
          this.algorithm = algorithm;
      }

      public String getAlgorithm() {
          return this.algorithm;
      }

      public String getFormat() {
          return "RAW";
      }

      /** Returns a copy of the key.
        * Make sure to clear the returned byte array when no longer needed.
        */
      public byte[] getEncoded() {
          if(null == key){
              throw new NullPointerException();
          }

          return key.clone();
      }

      /** Overwrites the key with dummy data to ensure this copy is no longer present in memory.*/
      public void destroy() {
          if (isDestroyed()) {
              return;
          }

          byte[] nonSecret = new String("RuntimeException").getBytes("ISO-8859-1");
          for (int i = 0; i < key.length; i++) {
            key[i] = nonSecret[i % nonSecret.length];
          }

          FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream("/dev/null");
          out.write(key);
          out.flush();
          out.close();

          this.key = null;
          System.gc();
      }

      public boolean isDestroyed() {
          return key == null;
      }
  }
Example in Kotlin:


class SecureSecretKey(key: ByteArray, algorithm: String) : SecretKey, Destroyable {
    private var key: ByteArray?
    private val algorithm: String
    override fun getAlgorithm(): String {
        return algorithm
    }

    override fun getFormat(): String {
        return "RAW"
    }

    /** Returns a copy of the key.
     * Make sure to clear the returned byte array when no longer needed.
     */
    override fun getEncoded(): ByteArray {
        if (null == key) {
            throw NullPointerException()
        }
        return key!!.clone()
    }

    /** Overwrites the key with dummy data to ensure this copy is no longer present in memory. */
    override fun destroy() {
        if (isDestroyed) {
            return
        }
        val nonSecret: ByteArray = String("RuntimeException").toByteArray(charset("ISO-8859-1"))
        for (i in key!!.indices) {
            key!![i] = nonSecret[i % nonSecret.size]
        }
        val out = FileOutputStream("/dev/null")
        out.write(key)
        out.flush()
        out.close()
        key = null
        System.gc()
    }

    override fun isDestroyed(): Boolean {
        return key == null
    }

    /** Constructs SecureSecretKey instance out of a copy of the provided key bytes.
     * The caller is responsible of clearing the key array provided as input.
     * The internal copy of the key can be cleared by calling the destroy() method.
     */
    init {
        this.key = key.clone()
        this.algorithm = algorithm
    }
}
```
Secure user-provided data is the final secure information type usually found in memory. This is often managed by implementing a custom input method, for which you should follow the recommendations given here. However, Android allows information to be partially erased from EditText buffers via a custom Editable.Factory.
```
EditText editText = ...; //  point your variable to your EditText instance
EditText.setEditableFactory(new Editable.Factory() {
  public Editable newEditable(CharSequence source) {
  ... // return a new instance of a secure implementation of Editable.
  }
});
```

Refer to the SecureSecretKey example above for an example Editable implementation. Note that you will be able to securely handle all copies made by editText.getText if you provide your factory. You can also try to overwrite the internal EditText buffer by calling editText.setText, but there is no guarantee that the buffer will not have been copied already. If you choose to rely on the default input method and EditText, you will have no control over the keyboard or other components that are used. Therefore, you should use this approach for semi-confidential information only.

In all cases, make sure that sensitive data in memory is cleared when a user signs out of the application. Finally, make sure that highly sensitive information is cleared out the moment an Activity or Fragment's onPause event is triggered.

Note that this might mean that a user has to re-authenticate every time the application resumes.
