    For each identified instance, identify its purpose and its type. It can be used:\n

- for encryption/decryption \n
- for signing/verifying \n
- for maintenance\n
        During verification the following checks should be performed:\n

- are all keys used according to the purpose defined during its creation?  \n
- for asymmetric keys, is the private key being exclusively used for signing and the public key encryption?\n
