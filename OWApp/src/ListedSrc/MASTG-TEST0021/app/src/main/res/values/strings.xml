    <string name="overview"> Developers often decide on simpler but less secure solutions (e.g., those that accept any certificate) to facilitate the development process, and sometimes these weak solutions make it into the production version , potentially exposing users to man-in-the-middle attacks .\n

Two key issues should be addressed:\n

- Verify that a certificate comes from a trusted source, i.e. a trusted CA (Certificate Authority).\n
- Determine whether the endpoint server presents the right certificate.\n
Make sure that the hostname and the certificate itself are verified correctly.\n Examples and common pitfalls are available in the official Android documentation. Search the code for examples of TrustManager and HostnameVerifier usage.
