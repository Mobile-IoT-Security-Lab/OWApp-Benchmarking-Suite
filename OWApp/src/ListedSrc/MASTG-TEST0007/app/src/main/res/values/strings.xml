    <string name="overvierw">To avoid SQL injection attacks within the app, use parameterized query methods, such as query, update, and delete. Be sure to properly sanitize all method arguments; for example, the selection argument could lead to SQL injection if it is made up of concatenated user input.

If you expose a content provider, determine whether parameterized query methods  (query, update, and delete) are being used to prevent SQL injection. If so, make sure all their arguments are properly sanitized.</string>
