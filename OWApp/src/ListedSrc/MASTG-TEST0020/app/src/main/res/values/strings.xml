    <string name="overview">Ensuring proper TLS configuration on the server side is also important. The SSL protocol is deprecated and should no longer be used. Also TLS v1.0 and TLS v1.1 have known vulnerabilities  and their usage is deprecated in all major browsers by 2020. TLS v1.2 and TLS v1.3 are considered best practice for secure transmission of data. Starting with Android 10 (API level 29) TLS v1.3 will be enabled by default for faster and secure communication. The major change with TLS v1.3  is that customizing cipher suites is no longer possible and that all of them are enabled when TLS v1.3 is enabled, whereas Zero Round Trip (0-RTT) mode isn\'t supported.\n
    If a mobile application connects to a specific server, its networking stack can be tuned to ensure the highest possible security level for the server\'s configuration. Lack of support in the underlying operating system may force the mobile application to use a weaker configuration.</string>
