    <string name="overview">Bypassing anti-debugging techniques varies based on the specific mechanisms used and the overall protection scheme. Here are different approaches:\n

- Patching the Anti-Debugging Functionality: This involves overwriting the anti-debugging code with NOP instructions or more complex patches if the mechanism is sophisticated.\n

- Using Frida or Xposed: These tools allow hooking APIs at the Java and native layers to manipulate the return values of functions like isDebuggable and isDebuggerConnected, effectively hiding the debugger.\n

- Changing the Environment: Modifying the Android operating system can subvert the developers\' assumptions, allowing you to bypass the anti-debugging techniques.
