# [MASTG-TEST-0044: Make Sure That Free Security Features Are Activated](https://mas.owasp.org/MASTG/tests/android/MASVS-CODE/MASTG-TEST-0044)
## Overview
MASVS-CODE-4 / MSTG-CODE-9 / May 08, 2023

## Implementation

The application performs the addition of two numbers using a native library. The vulnerability lies within the native library where the stack canary is disabled. To disable the stack canary, the following lines of code were added to the system file `CMakeLists.txt` :{https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/configure-cmake generated by Android Studio:

```java   
set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS "${CMAKE_C_FLAGS} -fno-stack-protector")
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -fno-stack-protector")
``` 

Disabling the stack canary makes the application vulnerable to stack overflow attacks, which could lead to arbitrary code execution or crashing of the application.


## Static Analysis
Test the app native libraries to determine if they have the PIE and stack smashing protections enabled.

You can use radare2's rabin2 to get the binary information. We'll use the UnCrackable App for [Android Level 4](https://mas.owasp.org/crackmes/Android/#android-uncrackable-l4) v1.0 APK as an example.

All native libraries must have canary and pic both set to true.

That's the case for libnative-lib.so:
```
rabin2 -I lib/x86_64/libnative-lib.so | grep -E "canary|pic"
canary   true
pic      true
```
But not for libtool-checker.so:

```
rabin2 -I lib/x86_64/libtool-checker.so | grep -E "canary|pic"
canary   false
pic      true
```
In this example, libtool-checker.so must be recompiled with stack smashing protection support.
